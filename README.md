# Wine Quality Prediction Project

![Wine Bottles](wine.jpg)

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction Project! This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset) from Kaggle. It includes various physicochemical properties of wines and their associated quality ratings.

## Project Structure

- `winequality.csv`: The dataset file in CSV format.
- `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the project.
- `wine.jpg`: Image used in the README.

## Approach

The project utilizes a linear regression model to predict wine quality based on the provided dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation steps.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: [https://github.com/shrey-a-bansal/wine-quality-prediction](https://github.com/shrey-a-bansal/Wine-Quality-Prediction-.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd wine-quality-prediction

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb` to see the step-by-step process.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required dependencies using: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter

Feel free to explore, modify, and improve upon the code to further enhance the model's performance.

Happy coding!
